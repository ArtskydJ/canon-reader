- links to specific chapter/verse numbers
	- need to get hash fragments working
	- something that works with hash-brown-router
	- use regular query parameters?
	- otherwise, need to strip any hash fragment from the hash-fragment-url and handle scrolling manually https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity/blob/master/js/routing.js#L25-L30
	- need to make it so that you get scrolled to the top after navigation anyway
		- maybe on stateChangeEnd, scroll to the top, unless there's a hash fragment
	- ok try this
		- add a click handler to all links
			- if it should be intercepted, and the hash fragment url ends with a fake-o hash fragment, and the rest of the url matches the current url, then preventDefault and scroll down to the id indicated by the fake-o hash fragment
			- on stateChangeEnd, if there's a fake-o hash fragment, scroll down to it
- chapter numbers, verse numbers
	- off to the side most of the time
- on hover of verse text
	- made the verse number prominent on the side
	- highlight the verse text somehow
- chapter navigation/selection at the top of the book page
- nicely readable
	- good serif font defaults
	- reasonable width on wide screens
	- responsive - move chapter/verse numbers inline somewhere on phone screens
- make shortcut-friendly
	- given a reference typed in, browse to it
	- keyboard shortcut that displays an input so you can type in a reference
	- a url scheme that works easily with browser location bar shortcuts
- move the book text processing to a build script and build individual book JSON to `public/books/*.json`
- lazy-load books
- store books locally
- add proper offline support
