- chapter numbers, verse numbers
	- off to the side most of the time
	- need to find a CSS-only solution, the current way with calculating/styling is way too slow
- on hover of verse text
	- made the verse number prominent on the side
	- highlight the verse text somehow
- nicely readable
	- good serif font defaults
	- reasonable width on wide screens
	- responsive - move chapter/verse numbers inline somewhere on phone screens
- make shortcut-friendly
	- given a reference typed in, browse to it
	- keyboard shortcut that displays an input so you can type in a reference
	- a url scheme that works easily with browser location bar shortcuts
- move the book text processing to a build script and build individual book JSON to `public/books/*.json`
- lazy-load books
- store books locally
- add proper offline support
